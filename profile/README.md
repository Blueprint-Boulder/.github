Blueprint Boulder is a dynamic student organization rooted in the heart of the University of Colorado Boulder. Our core mission is twofold: first, to passionately develop pro bono software solutions that empower non-profit organizations, enabling them to make a greater impact on their causes; and second, to provide a nurturing environment where students can cultivate essential skills that will serve them well in both their academic and professional journeys. At Blueprint Boulder, we believe in the transformative power of technology and education to create positive change, making a difference both in our community and in the lives of our dedicated members.
